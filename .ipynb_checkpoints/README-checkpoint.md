## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{One of the most significant issues facing Africa is what has been termed ‘brain drain.’ Although this has affected Africa, Africa would not have realised it had this issue had it not been losing even more of its people to malaria. Malaria is an important thing to analyse due to the recent continual increases in the prevalence of malaria. I personally think that this is also due to the increase of resistance that the plasmodia have to the newer medicines being produced. It looks more and more likely that these plasmodia will soon become entirely resistant to the newer medicines hence the need for Africa to zero down on preventive measures instead to reduce or restrict contact between human beings and the mosquitoes. I believe that it is possible to significantly reduce contact through sensitisation, provision of resources, law enactment that will prohibit the construction of entities in the mosquito’s major natural habitats amongst many others. The solution of this dilemma would surely enable Africa to expand in other aspects of development.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{This data being analysed was created by one of the writers at Lydia's library. This data utilised data from the world bank open data source. This data includes countries in Africa with significant malaria case reports hence comprised majorly of West, Central and East African regions over a course of 10 years from 2007 to 2017. The data includes reported incidences of malaria, the utility of insecticide-treated beds, children with fever receiving antimalarial drugs and many others. The data recorded can help one analyse the trend of growth and decline of malarial prevalence throughout Africa. The data also enables one to establish a correlation amongst some contributing factors of malaria and malaria itself. For example, it can be established that areas with high magnitudes of contaminated drinking water are mostly the same areas with a high prevalence of malarial incidences. The data can also be used to create choropleth maps for even better graphical analysis of this data.}
